  <h2> About Doraemon</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Doraemon</strong> is a robotic cat from the 22nd century who travels back in time
    to help a boy named <strong>Nobita Nobi</strong>. He’s kind, caring, and always ready with his 
    futuristic gadgets to solve everyday problems (and sometimes cause new ones! ).
  </p>

  <h3>Why We Love Doraemon</h3>
  <p>
    Doraemon teaches us that friendship and kindness can overcome any problem.
    He always forgives Nobita, helps his friends, and makes everyone smile.
    The show is full of fun, laughter, and life lessons — no matter your age! 
  </p>

  <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
  <p>
    Did you know Doraemon was originally yellow and had ears? But after a mouse bit them off,
    he turned blue and became afraid of mice forever!
